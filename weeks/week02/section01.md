## 1.1 Creating Lists

Lists can be created using square brackets. They can be modified by adding, removing, or changing elements.


### Syntax:

    ```python
    variables = [] # Variables that represent lists are named using plural
    ```


### Example:

    ```python
    test_cases = [] # An empty list
    test_cases = [1, 2, 3] # A list of numbers
    test_cases = ["1", "2", "3"] # A list of strings
    test_cases = ["Cat", 2] # A list of different data types
    test_cases = ["Login", "Logout", "Signup"]
    ```
