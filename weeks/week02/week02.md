# Week 2: Data Structures for Test Data

## Introduction

In this week, we will delve into various data structures in Python that are essential for managing test data in automation. Data structures provide a means to store, organize, and manipulate data efficiently, allowing for more effective test scripts. We will cover lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets, exploring their features and practical applications in test automation.

## Why Data Structures Matter in Test Automation

In test automation, managing test data efficiently is critical. You might be dealing with sets of input values, expected outputs, or configurations that need to be structured in a way that makes them easy to access and modify. Data structures are the backbone of any such storage mechanism.

By using data structures, test automation becomes `scalable` and `maintainable`. You can dynamically generate or modify test data instead of hard coding it in multiple places.


## What You Will Learn:
- Basic Python data structures: lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
