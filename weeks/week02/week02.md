# Week 2: Data Structures for Test Data

## Introduction

In this week, we will delve into various data structures in Python that are essential for managing test data in automation. Data structures provide a means to store, organize, and manipulate data efficiently, allowing for more effective test scripts. We will cover lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets, exploring their features and practical applications in test automation.

## Why Data Structures Matter in Test Automation

In test automation, managing test data efficiently is critical. You might be dealing with sets of input values, expected outputs, or configurations that need to be structured in a way that makes them easy to access and modify. Data structures are the backbone of any such storage mechanism.

By using data structures, test automation becomes `scalable` and `maintainable`. You can dynamically generate or modify test data instead of hard coding it in multiple places.


## What You Will Learn:
- Basic Python data structures: lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.

## Hands-On Exercises:

### Exercise 1:

Create a list of 10 different test case names for a web application.


### Exercise 2:

Convert the list of test cases into a dictionary mapping each case to an expected result (e.g., "Success" or "Failure").


### Exercise 3:

Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a list of only the even numbers.


### Exercise 4:

Create a tuple to store three constants used in your tests (e.g., HTTP status codes).


### Exercise 5:

Write a program that merges two sets and displays the unique values.


### Exercise 6:

Create a nested dictionary to represent user profiles, where each user has a name, email, and a list of test cases associated with them.


### Exercise 7:

Write a function that accepts a dictionary and returns a list of its keys.


### Exercise 8:

Given a list of items, write a program to remove duplicates using a set.


### Exercise 9:

Create a function that takes a dictionary and returns a new dictionary with keys sorted in alphabetical order.
