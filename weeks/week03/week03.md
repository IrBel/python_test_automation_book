# Week 3: File Handling and Regular Expressions in Testing

In this section, you will learn how to handle files in Python for reading and writing test data, as well as how to validate test data using regular expressions (regex). File handling is crucial for dealing with test data stored in files, and regex is an efficient tool for validating formats like emails, phone numbers, and other patterns commonly encountered in test automation.

## 3.3 Task Exercises:
#### Regex. Using Regex:
1. Define if a string contains the required characters. E.g. if '7865serS3' includes '583' - True; '973' - False
2. Count a number of Upper case letters in the string. E.g. '7865serS3' - 'Number of Capital letters: 1'
3. Define if the string contains at least one Upper case letter followed by Lower case letters. E.g. '75serS3' - False; '75WseTrS3' - True;
#### File Handling. 
1. Read the file and remove equal lines (if any).
2. Print out all words with length of n-characters
3. Combine two files into a third file
